# LSS_DDC
Example of looping sparse search and domain decomposition algorithms for reactive particle tracking

The included Matlab script will run the code used to generate the examples found in Engdahl, Schmidt, and Benson "Accelerating
      and parallelizing Lagrangian simulations of mixing-limited reactive transport"
      
One of the options requires the statistics and machine learning toolbox but the remiander do not.

The results are accurate to the best of our knowledge, but the code is provided as-is and is intended as an example, 
not a complete, standalone code.
